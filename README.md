# AI Chatbot

This project is a simple AI chatbot built using JavaScript and React, with API integration for generating bot responses.

## Features

- Real-time interaction with the bot
- Error handling for failed API requests

## Technologies Used

- Material-UI for UI components
- JavaScript for logic and API integration

## How It Works

1. Users can send a message by typing in the input field.
2. The message is displayed in the chat.
3. The message is sent to the server, where an AI chatbot API processes the input.
4. The response from the API is displayed as a bot message in the chat interface.
